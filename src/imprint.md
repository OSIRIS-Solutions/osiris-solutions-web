## Disclaimer

### Liability for content

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages pursuant to § 7(1) TMG.  
According to §§ 8–10 TMG, however, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or investigate circumstances indicating unlawful activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected.  
Liability in this regard is only possible from the moment we become aware of a specific infringement.  
Upon becoming aware of such issues, we will remove this content immediately.


### Liability for links

Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no control.  
We therefore cannot assume liability for these external contents.  
The respective provider or operator is always responsible for the contents of linked pages.

The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.  
Illegal content was not recognizable at that time.

Permanent content control of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of an infringement.  
Upon becoming aware of violations, we remove such links immediately.


### Copyright

Content and works created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law.  
Reproduction, editing, distribution and any type of use outside the limits of copyright law require written permission of the respective author.

Where content is not created by the operator, third-party copyrights are respected and marked accordingly.  
Should you nonetheless notice any infringement, please notify us.  
We will remove such content immediately.
